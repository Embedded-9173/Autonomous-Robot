# Autonomous-Robot
Firmware coding for Autonomous robot - mapping(SLAM)
an autonomous robot with 2D using ultrasonic sensor. Obstacle detection is carried out using ultrasonic sensor. 
We would also be using a temperature sensor which would monitor the temperature as the robot navigates. 
The mapping of the surrounding would be represented on the LCD panel. The temperature intensive is demarcated by red colour and other areas are demarcated by blue in the mapping. 
The temperature sensor also acts as a protection mechanism for the autonomous system to avoid areas of high temperature, heat or fire
